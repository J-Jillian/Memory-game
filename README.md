Memory Game
My first project as a developer is a memory game call Dumb ways to die.

This game was inspired by Dumb Ways to Die, an advertising campaign by the McCann Melbourne agency for Metro Trains, responsible for Melbourne's rail transport network. Its aim was to promote safety near train tracks.

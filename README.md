Memory game

My first project as a developer was a memory game called Dumb ways to die as part of the first assignment I did during my bootcamp at Ironhack.

Since the first module was about introducing ourselves to the programming world through JavaScript language, this application is 100% made with vanilla JavaScript.

The game was inspired by Dumb Ways to Die, an advertising campaign by the McCann Melbourne agency for Metro Trains, responsible for Melbourne's rail transport network. Its aim was to promote safety near the train tracks. 

As a fact all the illustrations of the cards are identical to some of the images of the campaign that I reillustrated with Adobe illustrator since I enjoy ilustrating.

!Hope you enjoy!
